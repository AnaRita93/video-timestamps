# Video Timestamps

## Why We Are Adding Timestamps

:stopwatch: We are adding timestamps to the PyMC YouTube videos.  When timestamps are available:
1. It makes it easy for viewers to get to the part in the video they are interested in.
2. It also helps potential viewers find the video based on their search terms.

:pray: Your helpful contribution is greatly appreciated!!
